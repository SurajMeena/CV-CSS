          <h3><a href="https://github.com/SurajMeena/Sentiment-Analysis-of-Online-Food-Reviews">Sentiment Analysis of Online Food Reviews</a></h3>
          <p>This project was completed under the guidance of Prof. Pradip Kumar Bala, Department of Information Systems, IIM Ranchi. The aim of the project was to perform <strong> sentiment analysis on twitter extracted data of online food delivery services like Zomato, Foodpanda, Swiggy twitter data from India</strong>. From obtained sentiments and mined text, the trained model was able to predict sentiment of any future tweets of this domain. With our analysis on hospitality related datasets, the possibilities for improving this aspect are almost endless, ranging from increased personalization to tailored recommendations.

          <p>I participated in the annual Data science hackelite organised by Gartner Inc. famous IT service and management company. The objective was to predict whether a client will retain and will keep continuing with gartner services or not. The dataset contained factors to measure the engagement over the time interval of the contract. The trained model attained a <strong> F1 score of 0.86</strong> on the test dataset. Then from the trained model infrenced were made to make suggestion on how to maximize the client retention.</p>

          <p>Delinquency occurs when a borrower misses a payment against his/her loan. This is a critical problem for the financial institution and organizations and hence prediction of future possible delinquencies is an important helpful measure for these institutions. Given the information like mortgage details, borrowers related details and payment details, the objective was to identify the delinquency status of loans for the next month given the delinquency status for the previous 12 months (in number of months). The developed model achived an <strong>F1 score of 0.3916 </strong> and I acheived a <strong>rank of 377 </strong> among around 3000 participants.
